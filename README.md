# Description
Wizard of oz prototype (I love that name) for the **perspective navigation** idea. Written in Python because that's what I can throw something together in the fastest and I ran out of timeeee (don't we all just love working in non-profits those always stay within expected work hours it's great). Will presumably rewrite later as something integratable w/ IMAGE.

## Usage
Execute the `oz_prototype.py` script, follow audio instructions.

## Missing
- The audio clips play on top of each other if you start one before the last one finishes.
- I'm not happy with all of the pings.
- Program exits before the "exiting" audio clip can play (does not actually matter for anything past this prototype but like. Sad.)
